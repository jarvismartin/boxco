    This project is a case study
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">based on the following criteria... </p>
  <section>
    <h2 class="my-10 text-2xl font-semibold">Back end</h2>
    <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold">The application should:</h3>
    <p>- be able to create/update products with price and stock quantity.</p>
    <p>- be able to create order with product and quantity.</p>
    <p>
      - be able to update order with shipping information, e.g. tracking
      company, tracking number.
    </p>
    <p>
      - be able to update order with status, e.g. processing, canceled,
      delivered.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-8 font-semibold">We care about:</h3>
    <p>
      - the scalability of the solution. Think of it as if there were 100, 10
      thousand, or millions of products.
    </p>
    <p>
      - how you explain your solution, with its opportunity and its limitation
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-10 text-2xl font-semibold">Front end</h2>
    <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold">The website should:</h3>
    <p>
      - be hosted and publicly accessible have a styling library/technology
      implemented
    </p>
    <p class="m-8 italic">
      I chose Tailwind CSS (with PostCSS) because it’s popular (well-supported
      and easy to find devs who know it or are excited to learn and use it, I
      think???), powerful, well-maintained, smaller than other options
      (performance). Speed and consistency. However, we could just as easily use
      Carbon, Bootstrap, etc. – whatever works best (read “most comfortable”)
      for the people paying for it. We could even use (some or all of) the
      customer’s css (e.g. scraped from their site) to do anything from white
      label the app to use a color palette consistent with their brand tooling,
      etc.

    <p class="m-8 italic">Ref: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit</p>
    <p>- have some dynamic styled components (like drop down or popups)</p>
    <h3 class="mb-2 mt-8 font-semibold">We care about:</h3>
    <p>- the website speed</p>
    <p>
      - the decisions on the choice of technologies (hosting, caching, language,
      frameworks, styling)
